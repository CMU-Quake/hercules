The following persons have contributed to the Quake project over the years:

Leonardo Ramirez	Initial formulation for the solving method and
			earthquake source generation.
			First version of quakesource.c, quakesource.h,
			geometrics.h.  Extensive contributions to psolve.c,
			stations.{c,h}, planes.{c,h}, checkpointing.{c,h}

Julio Lopez		Parallel I/O for bulk wavefield and mesh output 
			Initial version of output.{c,h}, util.{c,h},
			htimer.h, commutil.{c,h}, funcname.h.  Extensive
			changes to psolve.{c,h}, quakesource.c, cvm.c.
			Minor modifications to octor{c,h}.  Initial version
			of the etre library.

Ricardo Taborda		Non-linear formulation.  Initial version of
			non-linear.{c,h}.  Extensive contributions to psolve.c
