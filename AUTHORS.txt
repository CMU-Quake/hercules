The following persons have contributed to the Quake project over the years:

Leonardo Ramirez	Initial formulation for the solving method and
			earthquake source generation.
			First version of quakesource.c, quakesource.h,
			geometrics.h.  Extensive contributions to psolve.c,
			stations.{c,h}, planes.{c,h}, checkpointing.{c,h}

Julio Lopez		Parallel I/O for bulk wavefield and mesh output 
			Initial version of output.{c,h}, util.{c,h},
			htimer.h, commutil.{c,h}, funcname.h.  Extensive
			changes to psolve.{c,h}, quakesource.c, cvm.c.
			Minor modifications to octor{c,h}.  Initial version
			of the etre library.

Ricardo Taborda		Non-linear formulation.  Initial version of
			non-linear.{c,h}.  Extensive contributions to psolve.c
			
Haydar Karaoglu		New decomposition method.  Contributions to psolve.c

John Urbanic		Plane output routines. Initial version of plane.{c,h}
			Changes to geometrics.c

Tiankai Tu		Parallel octree mesh generation and etree library.
			First version of octor.c, octor.h, psolve.c and cvm
			modules.  Initial version of the the etree libray in
			the etree directory.

Jacobo Bielak		Mathematical formulation for the numerical solving
			method, damping, boundary conditions, earthquake
			source generation.

David O'Hallaron	Design of the overall parallel solver and mesh
			generator.
