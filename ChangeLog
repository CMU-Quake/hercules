	- Changed parameters being sent to com_allocpctl so that in this
	  first occasion it does not consider the case of buildings yet.

	(octor_carvebuildings):

	- Added new parameters: (1) a plugin from the buildings application;
	  and (2) a flag to handle the two different calls to this method

	  agreement with changes in octor.c related to tree_t.
	
	* quake/forward/qmesh:

	(main):
	
	  Added NULL as the second parameter in octor_partitiontree for

	  method.

********************************************************************************

2010-06-17 Ricardo Taborda <rtaborda@.cmu.edu>

	* ..............................checkpoint..............................

	* parameters.in:

	  New and modified lines apply to whether include buildings/foundations
	  into the model. The whole module is now controlled by the following
	  line

	  include_buildings = <yes> OR <no>

	  If the above parameter is <yes>, the following input lines apply:

	  number_of_buildings = <INTEGER>
	  min_octant_size_m   = <DOUBLE>
	  surface_shift_m     = <DOUBLE>
	  buildings_n_factor  = <INTEGER>
	  
	  If the number of buildings above is > 0 then the following table
	  applies:

	  building_properties =

	  min_x max_x min_y max_y depth height Vp Vs Rho Vp Vs Rho

	  All values are real.  Coordinates are in local XYZ coordinates
	  where X=North, Y=East, and Z=Depth.  Coordinates do not have to comply
	  with etree power of 2 grid. They are adjusted according to the closest
	  grid point using the minimum octant size in physical coordinates (or
	  meters).

	  The minimum octant size DO HAVE to be such that:

	  min_octant_size = L / ( 2 ^ N )
	 
	  where

	  L is the maximum (dominant) domain dimension, and
	  N is a positive integer.

	* matlab-utils/examples

	  Simplified file name: Replaced parameters_for_matlab.in for 
	  plotmeshinput.in

	* matlab-utils/scripts

	  Simplified file name: Replaced plot3d_Hercules_v2.m for plotmesh.m

	* octor/octor.h

	(bldgs_nodesearch_t)

	- New application provided plugin. Helps finding if a vertex does or
	  does not exist in the simulation domain.

	(octor_newtree)

	- Added input parameter surface_shift

	(octor_carvebuildings, octor_trimfirstleaf)

	- New public functions

	(octor_extractmesh)

	- Added input parameter (function plugin) bldgs_nodesearch.

	* octor/octor.c

	- Added two global variables: theSurfaceShift and theTotalDepth.
	  The former indicates for how much is the surfaces push down to 
	  have space for buildings. The latter is the dimension of the
	  model in depth or Z-direction.

	- Added a typedef struct that is a copy of the edata_t from psolve.h.
	  We will need to think about these copies in a future re-ingineering
	  of the whole program.

	(node_setproperty)

	- Completely refactored.  It now allows many more cases of 'touches'
	  to satisfy with the different options posed by pushing the surface
	  down and including buildings that protrude from the surface after
	  they are carved off from the mesh including air elements.

	  A vertex can now be touched by 8, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 and 1 elements.
	  The case for 7 touches is there but throws an immediate error.

	  Some of these cases will help in the future to implement topography.

	  Each case is well documented with comments at the beginning and
	  throughout their sub-cases.

	(octor_carvebuildings)

	- This new method identifies which elements or leaves have a payload 
	  with a negative value of Vp and eliminates those leaves from the tree.
	  When a leaf is eliminated, other tree structures and counters are
	  updated.

	- If a processor is to be left without any element, the method prevents
	  itself of allowing this by leaving at least one (first/leftmost) leaf
	  in the local tree, even if this leaf has a negative Vp.

	(octor_trimfirstleaf)

	- This new method eliminates the first leaf of the local tree if
	  this leaf has a negative value of Vp.  It corrects the special case
	  describe above.  It occurs after partitioning, thus it assumes that
	  all processors have now more than 1 leaf/element.

	(backfire_parent)

	- Is a new recursive method invoked by octor_carvebuildings and
	  octor_trimfirstleaf to make sure that a parent for whom all children
	  leafs have been eliminated because of them having a negative Vp
	  is also erased from the tree. Once this happens it calls itself
	  recursively to make sure that grandpas, great-grandpas and so one
	  do have childrens with data.

	(octor_partitiontree)

	- Added a temporary sanity check to make sure that after partition,
	  the first leaf is not pointing to NULL.  May be eliminated later on
	  when we get sure the buildings carving is working properly.

	- Changed the tree_showstat to 'details' instead of 'brief'.

	(octor_extractmesh)

	- Added new parameter. A plugin to be sent to the node_setproperty
	  method.

	- Added two sanity checks before traversing the elements to create 
	  the vertices.  May be eliminated later on when we proof the 
	  buildings package.

	- Improved error messaging.

	- Additional sanity check before doing the direct sharing. For later
	  elimination.

	- Also in direct sharing loop.  Corrected style of discards for
	  potential neighboring vertices.

	- Added a provision to discard vertices that are in the 'air'.

	- Added a sanity check to make sure that the returned procid from
	  match_zsearch exists.

	- Improved error message for when node_setproperty returns a negative
	  value.

	* quake/cvm

	  cvmpayload_t is now a typedef from the go.

	* quake/forward/io_planes.h

	  Added copyright header.

	(planes_setup)

	  Added parameter surfaceShift

	* quake/forward/io_planes.c

	- Added copyright header.

	(planes_setup)

	  Added parameter surfaceShift

	(Old_planes_setup, New_planes_setup)

	- Now take the surface shift and adjust the planes origin accrdingly.

	* quake/forward/qmesh.c

	  ***WARNING***  
	  Changed octor_ calls to comply with the new buildings package.
	  Not tested.  Only changed to ensure compilation.

	* quake/forward/quake_util.c

	  Cosmetic changes.

	* quake/forward/quakesource.h

	(compute_print_source)

	  Added new parameter: surfaceShift.

	* quake/forward/quakesource.c:

	  ***WARNING*** Buildings are only working properly with SRF source.

	(read_srf_source, source_init_parameters, compute_print_source)

	  Now accepting surfaceShift to adjust source location in the case
	  of buildings.

	* quake/forward/psolve.c

	- New controller for buildings is a No/Yes flag.

	- Renamed controller for nonlinear analysis.

	(setrec)

	- Added provisions to capture data in octants that belong to a
	  building.

	- Added an if statement to check if the query point needs to be
	  pushed down by the surface-shift.

	(mesh_generate)

	- Added parameter in octor_newtree

	- Adedd calls to octor_carvebuildings and octor_trimfirstleaf.

	- Added plugin-passing parameter to octor_extractmesh.

	(toexpand, mesh_correct_properties)

	- Refactored for the case of buildings.

	(print_timing_stat)

	- Added new octor_ buildings-methods timers.

	(source_init)

	- Now passing the surfaceShift.

	(read_stations_info)

	- Now adjusting depths for the case of buildings.

	(main)

	- Modified to make all calls to comply with buildings new provisions
	  and passing parameters.

	* quake/forward/buildings.h
	* quake/forward/buildings.c

	  Almost completely refactored.  Took all the work Yigit had done
	  for the special case of foundations and converted it in what we have
	  envisioned for the case of full rectangular-prismatic buildings.

	  It would be pointless to describe the many changes done. It is well
	  commented and organized.  Refer to the header of each method for
	  explanations.

2010-06-02 Yigit Isbiliroglu <yisbilir@.andrew.cmu.edu>

	* meshformatlab.c
	
	(saveMeshCoordinatesForMatlab)
	
	- This function is modified such that a processor will create output binary 
	  files if that processor has elements within the specified boundary. In
	  other words, no empty binary files will be created. For this int counter
	  is added.

	* matlab-utils/
	
	- plot3d_Hercules.m is also modified to be compatible with the changes in
	  saveMeshCoordinatesForMatlab. Its name is changed to plot3d_Hercules_v2.m
		
********************************************************************************

2010-05-17 Ricardo Taborda <rtaborda@.cmu.edu>

	* parameters.in:

	- New lines applicable only if nonlinear flag is active. The parameters
	  input file should have these two lines:

	  geostatic_loading_time_sec   = 0
	  geostatic_cushion_time_sec   = 0

	  Values have to be 0 or greater than 0, and their sum cannot be
	  greater that the total simulation time.  Their sum will effectively
	  delay the starting of the source (srfh only) and this time should be
	  considered for defining the simulation time.

	* quake/forward/psolve.c:

	(local_init):

	- Added definition LOCAL_INIT_DOUBLE_MESSAGE_LENGTH to control the
	  number of doubles to be sent and recieved.

	- Eliminated the USECVMDB specific extension to double_message and
	  created a double_message_extra instead, that is only created if
	  the compilation flag is defined.  Changed the casting and collection
	  of data accordingly.

	(solver_nonlinear_state):

	- Modified input parameters to reflect changes related to the new
	  geostatic loading functions described below.

	- Added call to compute_bottom_reactions conditioned to the
	  geostatic loading time.

	(solver_compute_force_gravity):

	- New method that controls the call to compute_addforce_gravity
	  described below.

	  in the nonlinear module described below.

	(solver_run_collect_timers):

	- Added new timer for addforces gravity.

	(solver_run):

	- Added/modified calls to solver_nonlinear_state, solver_compute_gravity
	  and solver_geostatic_fix.

	(printing_timing_stat):

	- Added new timer for gravity forces calculation.

	(source_init):

	- Added globalDelayT (global delay in time for the source in seconds).
	  For now, this is ONLY VALID for the srfh source type.  It delays the
	  starting time of the source to accomodate time for the geostatic
	  loading and cushion. Its value is passed to compute_print_source.

	(main):

	- Added parameters to call of nonlinear_init().

	- Moved nonlinear_solver_init and nonlinear_stations_init to before
	  calling source_init.

	- Added call to check_balance().  This function checks if the weight
	  of the model matches that of the reactions for after geostatic loading
	  is applied.  Will need to be relocated and added provisions for
	  handleing errors.

	* quake/forward/quakesource.h:

	(compute_print_source):
	
	- Added parameter globalDelayT

	* quake/forward/quakesource.c:

	(read_srfh_source):

	- Added parameter globalDelayT.

	- This parameter is added to all theSourceTinitArray entries.

	(source_init_parameters, compute_print_source):

	- Added parameter globalDelayT

	* quake/forward/nonlinear.h:

	- Added typedef struct bottom_elements_f. It has an id that maps to the
	  table of elements and a vector with the nodal forces to be used as
	  reactions at the bottom.

	(get_geostatic_total_time, compute_addforce_gravity,...)
	(compute_bottom_reactions, geostatic_displacement_fix, check_balance):

	- New method prototypes.

	* quake/forward/nonlinear.c:

	- New global variables: theGeostaticLoadingT, theGeostaticCushionT,
	  theGeostaticFinalStep, myBottomElementsCount, myBottomElements,
	  totalWeight.

	- Some cosmetic changes.

	(get_geostatic_total_time):

	- Returns the sum of the two variables defining the total
	  geostatic loading time.

	(nonlinear_init):

	- Added new parameters to apss on to nonlinear_initparameters.

	- Increased the double and int messages arrays.

	- Added boradcasting of new global variables mentioned above.

	(nonlinear_initparameters):

	- Added new arguments and local variables.

	- Now reading geostatic loading parameters.

	(isThisElementAtTheBottom):

	- New method that returns YES if an element is at the bottom, NO
	  otherwise.

	(nonlinear_print_stats, nonlinear_stats):

	- Now prints/collect infor for how many elements there are at the 
	  bottom of the model.

	(nonlinear_solver_init):

	- Now calls for counting and mapping the bottom elements for geostatic
	  loading.

	(check_yield_limit):

	- Set the limit back to 1.5---need more research before settling for
	  a good value.

	(smooth_rise_factor):

	- New method. Returns a factor between 0 and 1 depending on the current 
	  step in the pre-simulation stage for geostatic loading. This factor
	  is used to calculate the progressive addition og gravitational
	  forces.

	(add_force_reactions):

	- New method. It adds the reactions at the bottom to compensate the 
	  weight of the model once it is released for the simulation.

	(check_balance):

	- New method. Does not actually checks (it should in the future) but
	  for now it simply prints to stdout the result and difference of
	  the total weight of the model and the sum of the reactions at the
	  bottom.  They should match or be sufficiently close to avoid
	  numerical errors.

	(compute_addforce_gravity):

	- New method. It computes the contribution of each elememt's weight
	  for geostatic loading and once total pre-loading is reached it also
	  calls for adding the reactions at the bottom.

	(compute_bottom_reactions):

	- New method. Computes the reactions at the bottom elements due to
	  the deformation these elements suffered because of geostatic
	  loading. It uses the conventional stiffness matrix - displacements
	  product.

	(geostatic_displacements_fix):

	- New method. Fixes the vertical displacement of the bottom nodes
	  for applying geostatic gravitational loading.

	* matlab-utils/

	A new feature is added to program. A matlab function 'plot3d_Hercules.m'
	that plots 3d meshing of any specified region within domain is added 
	into newly created file 'matlab-utils'. Its usage is decribed in the 
	script itself. A sample 'parameters.in' file is also added in the 
	subfolder 'examples' under matlab-utils.
	
********************************************************************************

2010-05-19 Yigit Isbiliroglu <yisbilir@.andrew.cmu.edu>

	A new feature is added to program. Now, any specific portion of domain 
	can be plotted in 3D via MATLAB. For this, meshformatlab.c and 
	meshformatlab.h are created. Element coordinates and data are stored 
	in binary format. 4th dimension in plot can be Vp, Vs or rho depending 
	on user preferences. It also can be id of processor which possesses 
	the data of corresponding element.
	
	* parameters.in

	- Added lines defining the parameters for mesh properties of matlab.
	  One of the following two options should be added to parameters.in
	
	# Mesh properties for matlab
	
	mesh_coordinates_for_matlab            = no
	
	OR
	
	# Mesh properties for matlab

	- Added char mesh_coordinates_for_matlab[64].
	
	- Added  noyesflag_t  meshCoordinatesForMatlab and initialized as -1.
	
	- mesh_coordinates_for_matlab is parsed by PE0 from parameters.in and 
	  sanity check is done to make sure it is either 'yes' or 'no'. Then,

	* quake/forward/psolve.c: 

	(interpolate_station_displacements):

	- Changed the format for printing the time in the station files to a
	  larger number of significant figures to avoid cut numbers when a very
	  small delta t is required.

	- Added a 'cor-now-commented' section to print velocities as well.

	(main):

	- Added extra argument in the call of nonlinear_solver_init.

	- Moved the call to nonlinear_stations_init to after the nonlinear
	  solver has been done.

	* quake/forward/nonlinear.h:

	- Added four new method declarations related to initialization of non-
	  linear variables and structs and printing stats. More details below.

	* quake/forward/nonlinear.c:

	- Added golval variables for counting nonlinear elements per PE and
	  for mapping nonlinear elements data to the regular list in myMesh.

	(nonlinear_elements_count):

	- New method. Counts the number of elements that have a Vs less than
	  the nonlinear Vs cut especified in the parameters file.

	(nonlinear_elelemts_mapping):

	- New method. Allocates memory for the mapping vector in accordance with
	  previous method and then loops over all elements sotirng the local
	  element index to the complete list in myMesh.

	(nonlinear_print_stats):

	- New method. Prints stats about the number of nonlinear elements per
	  PE and the number of stations in nonlinear elements.

	(nonlinear_stats):

	- New method. Gathers the number of nonlinear elelemts and stations in
	  each PE and pass them to PE0 for printing.

	(nonlinear_solver_init):

	- Added theGroupSize as paremeter.

	- Added the call to the nonlinear elelemts count and mapping methods 
	  and stats method.

	- Change the allocation of memory for nonlinear solver to be dependant
	  on the local number of nonlinear elements and not on the total local
	  nomber of elements.

	- Change loop over all elements to be over nonlinear elements only and
	  subsequent indexing accordingly.

	(compute_addforce_nl, compute_nonlinear_entities)
	(nonlinear_stations_init, print_nonlinear_entities):

	- Change loop over all elements to be over nonlinear elements only and
	  subsequent indexing accordingly.  Also commented out check to the 
	  nonlinear vs cut because the above makes it unnecessary.

********************************************************************************

2010-01-29 John Urbanic <urbanic@psc.edu>

	* quake/forward/psolve.c

	(main)
	
	- Eliminated all traces of argv[3], the old physics.in file and shifted
	  all arguments accordingly in all subroutines called here.  Also fixed
	  comments.

	(local_init)

	- Combined 2 and 3 args as per above.

	(initparamters)

	- Collapsed both arguments into one as per above.  Just aliased

	* quake/forward/nonlinear.c:

	- Added global variables for mapping the stations that fall in nonlinear
	  elements with the complete list of stations. The variables are the
	  integer myNumberOfNonlinStations and the vector 
	  myNonlinStationsMapping.

	(compute_addforce_nl):
	
	- Moved the changed of the sign in the forces to the final passing to
	  the nodalForce vector and keep original commented out until this is
	  well understood.
	
	(compute_nonlinear_entities):
	
	- Deleted the old code for printing that was commented out. The new
	  methods for printing are well tested now.

	(nonlinear_stations_init):

	- Added a first pass loop over the stations to determine how many fall
	  in nonlinear elements.

	- Added allocation for the mapping vector and changed the allocations

	- Changed loop limit to the number of nonlinear stations.

	- Erased old average methods that were commented out.

********************************************************************************

2010-01-20 Ricardo Taborda <rtaborda@cmu.edu>

	* quake/forward/nonlinear.c:

	(compute_addforce_nl):
	
	- The vs cut is now correctly checked with the input parameter
	
	(compute_nonlinear_entities):
	
	- Added a provision to detect if the nonlinear run needs a smaller delta t.
	  It stops the simulation and prints out the location of the critical
	  element.
	  
	- Added a provision for the impossed LINEAR case and corrected the hard-
	  coded check on the vs cut to be the one provided in the input parameters.
	  
	(print_nonlinear_entities):
	
	- Override the localcoords of the station to print the average/middle point
	  of the element. Inter- extra-polation outside the quadrature points is
	  causing erroneous data. We need a better method here.

	* quake/forward/psolve.c:

	(solver_run):

	- Added call to print_nonlinear_entities.

	(setup_stations_data):

	- Wrapped the printing of nodes in a DEBUG ifdef block. Printing this
	  is irrelevant unless one is doing some debugging.

	- Changed the headings in the stations file to be aligned with the
	  data and added a header for when nonlinear flag is ON.

	(interpolate_station_displacements)

	- Changed back the format for printing displacements to how it was
	  originally done by Leo.  Julio had changed this a while ago. It turns
	  out that the original way is advantageous for how the nonlinear
	  module adds data to be printed out. Added a very visible warning
	  to avoid someone changes it again in the future.

	(main):

	- Added call to nonlinear_stations_init.
	
	* quake/forward/nonlinear.c: 

	- Added global variable myStationsElementIndices to handle the element 
	  indices for printing nonlinear data to stations.

	(nonlinear_solver_init):

	- Commented out global variables and code for getting global maxima
	  parameters. This will be refactored later in a more clever way.

	- Eliminated some old and commented out code.

	(compute_addforce_nl):

	- Added a provision to return without changes to the force vector for
	  the LINEAR case.

	- Cleaned up and did cosmetic changes.

	(compute_nonlinear_entities):

	- Added loop to store the sqrtJ2 values in the nonlinear element's 
	  data structure (enlcons).

	- Commented out all code related to printing and maxima and averages
	  calculation.  Will be later removed.

	(nonlinear_stations_init):

	- New method for setting up the element indices of stations.

	(interextrapolate):

	- New method to inter- and extra-polate nonlinear related quantities 
	  from the quadrature points to any other point in the element.

	(print_nonlinear_entities):

	- New method to handle printing nonlinear data to stations. There is
	  pending work to identify if the station has indeed an element with
	  nonlinear data or not.

	* quake/forward/nonlinear.h:

	- Added sqrtJ2 to the enlconstants_t struct. Needed it for printing.

	- Added declaration of methods for printing and interpolation.

2010-01-06 Ricardo Taborda <rtaborda@cmu.edu>

	* quake/forward/io_planes.c: 
	
	- Added inlcude quake_util.h to conform with parsedarray
	  having been moved there. This eliminates a warning.
	  
	* quake/forward/quakesource.c:
	
	- Added inlcude quake_util.h to conform with parsedarray
	  having been moved there. Also rearrange inlcudes in alphabetical order.
	  
	- Eliminated two unnecessary definitions (LINESIZE and ERROR)

	(parsedarray):
		
	- Erased the parsedarray method and moved it to quake_util.c.

	* quake/forward/quakesource.h:
	
	- Eliminated unnecesary definition of LINESIZE
	
	- Eliminated the declaration of method parsedarray.
	
	* quake/forward/quake_util.c:
	
	- Added and rearrange includes.
	
	(parsedarray):
	
	- Added parsedarray method. Was originally in quakesource. It is now also
	  used by nonlinear.c.  Having it at a higher level sourcecode makes it
	  vissible to necessary parties.
	
	* quake/forward/quake_util.h:
	
	- Added definition of LINESIZE.  This is defined at several places in the
	  code. We should try to unify this and others (e.g., PI).
	
	- Added declaration of method parsedarray.
	
	* quake/forward/nonlinear.c:
	
	- Added include quake_util.h
	
	- Change the global matrix theMaterialProperties to three vectors that are
	  easier to broadcast and their names are more meaningful.
	  
	(interpolate_property_value):
	(get_alpha):
	(get_kay):
	
	- Added these three new methods and place them in a utilities block.  They
	  help to read information from numerical.in that was initially hard-coded.
	  
	(nonlinear_local_init):
	
	- Change and corrected the memory allocation of the new vectors and their
	  broadcasrting to all processors after being read by PE0.
	  
	(nonlinear_initparameters):
	
	- Corrected typo in string comparison for DruckerPrager material model.
	
	- Added returns to the sanity checks so they do stop the program.
	
	- Change and corrected the memory allocation of the new vectors for PE0.
	  Before I was using a matrix.
	  
	(nonlinear_solver_init):
	
	- Changed from hard-coded assignment of nonlinear material properties to
	  the new user-friendly methods to read this information from numerical.in.
	
	* quake/forward/nonlinear.h:
	
	- Eliminated unnecessary definitions that had been commented out.
	
	- Added new declarations for methods: interpolate_property_value, get_alpha,
	  and get_kay. 
	
********************************************************************************

2010-01-05 Ricardo Taborda <rtaborda@cmu.edu>

	  Added new feature to the program. Now we can soften the material
	  properties according to the mesh final structure. Elements with 
	  stiff soil or rock-like properties in small elements (due to the
	  2-to-1 rule) are softened. By lowering Vs and Vp values down to 
	  a certain factor times the 'ideal' values, the cirtical delta t
	  may double, bringing simulation time down.

	* numerical.in:
	
	  A new line needed.
	  
	  softening_factor = <double>
	  
	  <double> must be 0 if you wan't no changes, or >= 1 for mesh
	  softening to take place. Read more below.

	* quake/forward/psolve.c: 

	- Added global variable theSofteningFactor. This variable can take
	  0 for no softening, and values greater or equal to 1. A value of
	  1 results in maximum softening. We need more testing on the 
	  consecuences of this factor, for now farctors > 4 or 5
	  are suggested.

	(local_init):

	- increased double_message size to 17

	- added theSofteningFactor to the passing message array for the
	  way forward and back and changed the corresponding number of
	  doubles passed in the MPI_Bcast.

	(initparameters):

	- added local variable for reading the softening_factor and a
	  line in the onvocation of the parsing.

	- added sanity check for the softening factor and instruction to
	  feed the global variable of PE0.

	- Did other cosmetic changes.

	(setrec):

	- correct an error in the definiton of points array.

	(etree_correct_properties):

	- Added local variable RhoVpRatio for correction of material
	  properties. I have pending discussion with Jacobo about it.

	- Re-arrange the adjustment of properties and added the new 
	  section that actually does the softening of the mesh 
	  transitions.

	- Refactor some internal names and did other cosmetic changes.
	
	* quake/forward/nonlinear.c
	
	- Included quakesource.h.  This will later be repared by moving some

	- Refactored the way everything is about reading data from input files.
	  The nonlinear_init is now done in two methods nonlinear_local_init,

	  This will allow us to	maintain backwards compatibility with non-
	  server 1 core IO code.

	* quake/forward/io_planes.c 

	- Duplicated all routines with Old_/New_ versions and added a wrapper 
	  to redirect calls based upon server activation.  Fixed Old_ calls for 
	  internal consistancy (Old_ only call Old_).  Need to do that with

********************************************************************************

2009-12-09 Haydar Karaoglu <hkaraogl@andrew.cmu.edu>

	* numerical.in
	
	- Added a new paramter to define the method that will be used for the

	  or
	      
	      stiffness_calculation_method = conventional

	* quake/forward/Makefile:

	* quake/forward/psolve.c:

	- Removed two unused globals, added IO_POOL_PE_COUNT and
	  IO_POOL_PES[] as statics to track IO PEs.

	- Added final main loop logic for IO PEs.  They call planes_IO_
	  PES_main() and then return via an evil goto to the end of main().
	  This whole routine should be a case statement to avoid the goto.

	* quake/forward/io_planes.c:

	- Added planes_IO_PES_main() for IO Pool PEs.  Deleted two
	  unused globals.

	* quake/forward/io_planes.h:

	  output_planes_construct_strips() are now static/private.

	- planes_interpolate_communicate_and_print(), output_planes_setup();
	  extern void output_planes_finalize() and now renamed to 
	  planes_print(),planes_setup(),planes_close() and added some
	  new arguments to pass previous globals in psolve.

	* created quake/forward/io_planes.h:

	- planes_print(),planes_setup(),planes_close() defined.

	* quake/forward/psolve.c:

	- added io_planes.h and deleted code that was moved to io_planes.c

	- updated planes_ calls to conform to new names and args

	- changed compute_csi_eta_dzeta() to extern so that it could be
	called from io_planes.c as well as here.  This should be moved to
	a utility file.

	- Made these variables global as they are used by io_planes and
	  stations code at least.  They should be collected into into two
	  structures (DomainDescription and InputParams for ex.) along with
	  related globals and passed as structures.  I will do this when I
	  redo the input parsing:

	  theRegionLong, theRegionLat, theRegionDepth, theNumberOfPlanes,
	  thePlaneDirOut[256], theSurfaceCornersLong[4], theSurfaceCornersLat[4],
	  thePlanePrintRate, theNumberOfPlanes, thePrintPlaneTime = 0,

	- Included nonlinear.o in the PSOLVE_OBJECTS and added nonlinear.h
	  for the psolve.o target.

	* quake/forward/quakesource.c:

	- Commented out the definition of ERROR. This definition is now at
	  psolve.h and instead of -100, its value is set to HERC_ERROR.

	- Typedef struct edata_t was erased. This structure is now at
	  psolve.h and is visible from there to the nonlinear module.

	- Commented out the search_point method because this code already
	  existed in psolve.c.

	* quake/forward/geometrics.h:

	- Added include "psolve.h" to allow visibility to some common
	  definitions.

	- Commented out typedef struct vector3D_t that is now in psolve.h

	* quake/forward/geometrics.c:

	- Moved the inlcude "geometrics.h" statement to after the system
	  libraries.

	* quake/forward/nonlinear.h:

	- This file is all new. It contains the definitions and
	  declarations used in nonlinear.c.

	* quake/forward/nonlinear.c:

	- All new. This file has the methods relative to the incorporation
	  of nonlinear soil conditions.

	* quake/forward/psolve.h:

	- Added include "octor.h" and the definition of ERROR as
	  HERC_ERROR.

	- Added the typedef struct edata_t, messenger_t, schedule_t,
	  my_solver_t, and station_t.  All these structs were in psolve.c
	  but needed to be visible to the nonlinear module---thus the
	  decision to move them here.

	- Brought the struct vector3D_t from geometrics.h to here to make
	  it available to the nonlinear module. In the future it would be
	  good if we can unify this structure with fvector_t. They are
	  almost identical and used in very similar conditions all over the
	  code.

	- Added declaration of search_point method (no longer a static
	  method).

	- Added declaration of method mu_and_lambda.

	* quake/forward/psolve.c:

	- Added include "nonlinear.h" statement.

	- Eliminated the definion of ERROR, now at psolve.h.

	- Added timers variables for the nonlinear module (NL,NL2).

	- Eliminated edata_t struct, now at psolve.h.

	- Commented out (for later elimination): messenger_t, schedule_t,
	  and mysolver_t. These typedefs are now at psolve.h---so they may
	  be totally eliminated from psolve.c later on once we agree
	  psolve.h is the right place for them to be.

	- Included some declarations for the nonlinear module. Most remain
	  commented out and will be erased later.

	- Commented out three global variables related to planes writint
	  that were not being used and they were triggering unnecessary
	  compilation warnings.

	- Erased typedef struct station_t, now at psolve.h. This structure
	  is also being used by the nonlinear module---thus the need for
	  moving it.

	(local_init):
	
	- Made int_message larger for including the nonlinear flag.

	- Added the doNonlinear message passing ints.

	(initparameters):

	- Added char inlcude_nonlinear_analysis for be read from
	  numerical.in and the inlcudeNonlinear flag.

	- Reformat the parsetext calls for easier reading. Added the line
	  that reads the nonlinear flag from numerical.in

	- Added a sanity check for the nonlinear flag read from
	  numerical.in.

	- Corrected an undetectable bug with missing check in the
	  parsetext call for reading the region_azimuth.

	- Added a sequence of monitor_print calls for printing very basic
	  data about the run at the top of the monitor file.

	(replicateDB): 

	  moved the declaration of char curdir[256] into the
	  compilation-controlled section CVM_DESTDIR that does use it. This
	  eliminates a compilation warning.

	(solver_init): 

	  eliminated the section that was calculating the
	  Lame constants mu and lambda, now done in an independent method.

	(planes_interpolate_communicate_and_print): 

	  Commented out several variables that were not being used and were 
	  causing unnecessary warnings during compilation.

	(solver_run):

	- Changed the progress monitor_print to include the NL and NL2
	  timers and to avoid the single star printed for the startingstep.

	- Added statements to go into compute_nonlinear_entities and
	  compute_addforce_nl.

	- Reformat indentation.

	(print_timing_stat):

	- Added timers NL and NL2 to the final report.

	- Changed search_point to be a non-static method so that it can be
	  shared with the nonlinear module.

	(output_planes_construct_strips): 

	  Commented unused variables.

	(main): 

	  Added the statement to call nonlinear_init.

2009-11-24 Ricardo Taborda <rtaborda@cmu.edu>

	* ChangeLog: 

	  Changed the format of this file so that we keep
	  adding the changes at the top and not at the bottom.  This makes
	  it easier to read/write the latest changes.

********************************************************************************

2009-11-19 Ricardo Taborda <rtaborda@cmu.edu>

	* systemdef.mk: 

	  Added a new system configuration for running
	  locally at hooke.cml.cs.cmu.edu.  It is basically a copy of the
	  linux-mpich configuration but it is being used regularly enough to
	  make it to the repository.

********************************************************************************

2009-10-28 John Urbanic <urbanic@psc.edu>

	- All changes this checkin were to enable creation of non-solver
	  pools of PEs.  The overall theme was to eliminate references to
	  MPI_COMM_WORLD.  The numerous exceptions are for Abort calls.

	* octor/octor.h: 

	  Include <mpi.h>.  New function declaration for
	  octor_newtree() to pass in communicator.  New member of octree
	  type to hold it.

	* octor/octor.c: 

	  New communicator member added in tree type to
	  compensate for overlay on octree type. Added MPI_Comm argument to
	  com_OrchestrateExchange() to pass in communicator. Replaced all
	  MPI_COMM_WORLDs with tree comm member except for Aborts.

	* quake/forward/psolve.c: 

	  Changed Octor_newtree() call as per above. Added in comm_solver as 
	  global to replace MPI_COMM_WORLD, and did so everywhere except Abort 
	  calls and communicator creation.  Added communicator creation in 
	  main().  This uses IO_POOL_SIZE now, but will be superceded by a 
	  user input parameter.

	* quake/forward/psolve.h: 

	  Added in comm_solver global to replace MPI_COMM_WORLD. 
	  Included <mpi.h>.

	* quake/forward/output.c: 

	  Replaced all MPI_WORLD_COMMs except for Aborts.

	* quake/forward/util.h: 

	  Replaced MPI_WORLD_COMMs in HU_COND_EXEC macro.

	* quake/forward/quakesource.c: 

	  Replaced all MPI_WORLD_COMMs except for Aborts.

	* quake/forward/qmesh.c: 

	  Updated call to octor_newtree() with additional parameter as per 
	  above.

********************************************************************************

2009-09-07 John Urbanic <urbanic@psc.edu>

	General changes:

	- Added copyright header to all .c and .h files
	- Added XT5 system type to systemdef.mk
	- Added in sample user.mk for reference

********************************************************************************

2009-09-03 Julio Lopez <jclopez@ece.cmu.edu>

	* examples/simple:

	  Added new simple test scenario for aiding regression testing and 
	  debugging.

	* quake/forward/psolve.c:

	(setup_stations_data):

	  Change in the format for the stations output.

	(interpolate_station_displacements): 

	  Change in the format for the stations output.

	* version:

	  Increased version number.

	* octor/octor.c:

	- In tree_getmaxleaflevel, tree_getminleaflevel, octor_getmaxleaflevel,
	  and octor_getminleaflevel: Made parameter 'const'.

	- In octor_getmaxleaflevel and octor_getminleaflevel: Made parameter 
	  'const'.

	* quake/forward/util.h:

	- In DEF_XFREE_TYPE: Added new macro to define functions following the 
	  pattern 'xfree_type( type** v )'.  Used the macro to create xfree 
	  functios for int32_t* and char*.

	(hu_fclosep): 

	  New function declaration, see description below in util.c.

	* quake/forward/util.c (hu_fclosep): 

	  New function with parameter checks to close a file and then make 
	  the FILE pointer NULL to prevent future operations on the stream 
	  descriptor.

	* quake/forward/psolve.h:

	  Added new data types for global and local node ids.  However, these 
	  types are not widely used throughout the code yet.

	* quake/forward/psolve.c (mesh_print_stat): 

	  New implementation to print the mesh statistics that completely 
	  replaces the old implementation. The new features include:

	- Saving the stats to a file with a user chooseable file name.

	- Use of simpler MPI collective functions instead of the idiotic 
	  complex implementation using single message point-to-point 
	  primitives.

	  The purpose of saving the mesh stats to a separate file is two-fold:

	  1. It'll make it easier to go through the solver output.  The mesh 
	     stats become large when running on thousands of processors.
	  2. Having this stats in a separate file should make it easier to write 
	     scripts to process or plot the mesh data if needed.

********************************************************************************

2009-07-30 Julio Lopez <jclopez@ece.cmu.edu>

	* quake/forward/psolve.c (initparameters): 

	  Bug fix.  Corrected the parameter name and default value for the file 
	  name for mesh statistics.

********************************************************************************

2009-07-29 Julio Lopez <jclopez@ece.cmu.edu>

	* version:

	* newfile:

	  New file to keep track of a global version number ala svn.

	* tag-version.sh:

	  Helper script to manage the version file and create the appropriate 
	  tags in the repository.

	* quake/forward/quakesorce.c (filter_myForce): 

	  Bug fix.  An incorrectly place curly brace was causing the signal to 
	  be filtered multiple times, thus attenuating the signal.  After 
	  testing, the solver produces the same output as the version from
	  January 2009.

********************************************************************************

2009-05-13  Julio Lopez  <jclopez at ece dot cmu dot edu>

  quake/cvm/cvm.h:

    * In cvm_query: Changed signature, removed "field" parameter and added type 
      for the payload parameter (was void*).

  quake/cvm/cvm.c:

    * In cvm_query: Changed function to match signature in the cvm.h 
      declaration.

  quake/forward/psolve.c:

    * In setrec: Modified call to cvm_query to match new signature.

    * In etree_correct_properties: Modified call to cvm_query to match new 
      signature.

    * In setrec: Added check for the return value of the cvm_query call.
      Additional test to handle corner case where all the point queries fail 
      (no point is found).

  quake/forward/qmesh.c:

    * In setrec: Modified call to cvm_query to match new signature.

  quake/forward/quakesource.c:

    * In parsedarray: Fixed bug with an incorrectly placed curly brace. Argh!

********************************************************************************

2009-05-10  Julio Lopez  <jclopez at ece dot cmu dot edu>

  quake/forward/psolve.c:

    * In solver_printstat: Changed function signature to take as parameter the
      solver structure. Changed implementation to print the scheduler stats to
      a file instead of stdout. Added configuration parameters in the config 
      file to change the default name for the file to where the schedule is
      saved.

    * In solver_printstat_to_stream: New function to support the changes 
      mentioned in solver_printstat().

    * In setup_stations_data: Changed informational message print statement 
      (printf) so only PEs that have stations print the message. Also, the 
      format of the message was changed slightly, for instance to have the new 
      line at the end of the message, not at the beginning.

  quake/forward/quakesource.c

    * In source_broadcast_parameters: Bug fix. The value of 
      theThresholdFrequency was not being set after the broadcast. Instead 
      theSourceFunctionType value was incorrectly overwritten.

********************************************************************************

2009-04-20  Julio Lopez  <jclopez at ece dot cmu dot edu>

  quake/forward/quakesource.c:
  
    * In broadcast_info: Refactored as follows:
      - renamed as broadcast_source_parameters.
      - split into separate functions according to function type:
        broadcast_point_source_parameters, broadcast_plane_source_parameters 
        and broadcast_srfh_parameters.
      In the process, cleaned up the way some parameters were passed and group 
      them in as few arrays as possible based on the data type (double, int,
      etc).

    * In isforceinprocessor: Removed global variable and replaced with local 
      variables respectively.

    * In load_myForces_with_point_source: Changed signature. The function now 
      takes as parameters the bitmap indicating whether or not a fault force 
      falls in this processor. The name of the bitmap parameter is: 
      is_force_in_processor. The function does not reference the 
      isforceinprocessor global variable.

    * In open_filescomputemyForces: Removed function.

    * In source_get_local_forces_filename: New function, see documentation in 
      source file.

    * In compute_myForces_planes: Removed reference to isforceinprocessor global
      variable.  Replaced with local var.

    * In compute_myForces_srfh: Removed reference to isforceinprocessor global 
      variable.  Replaced with local var.

    * In compute_myForces_point: Removed reference to isforceinprocessor global 
      variable.  Replaced with local var. Modified to fix bug. The PEs that did 
      not contain the source were closing the file with the source data without 
      writing a header to it. Then, psolve.c:source_init was trying to read the 
      header from the file, but the file did not contain any data, so it was 
      aborting.  The change is to make PE that contains the source write the 
      file as before.  The ones that don't contain the source do nothing, i.e., 
      they do not create a file, which in turn reduces the stress on the file 
      system (FS).  Then, in psolve.c: source_init, the PEs that don't have 
      nodes loaded by the source do not even try to open the file, this further 
      avoids innecesary stress to the FS.  This oughta be the approach for the
      other source types, but not now, will implement at a later time.

  octor/octor.c:

    * In struct hdr_t: This is a stuct used to represent a chunk in the memory 
      pool manager. Added a pointer to the next memory chunk, and moved a 
      pointer to the next available object from the tlr_t struct to the hdr_t 
      struct. Modified the appropriate functions for the memory pool to match 
      the change in the structs.

    * In com_OrchestrateExchange: Removed reference to an object pointer in the 
      tlr_t struct, since (a) the field was not used and (b) the field was moved
      to the hdr_t struct. Note: Perhaps it should be initialized to NULL in 
      hdr_t as well.

  quake/forward/commutil.*: 
  
    * New files with utility helper functions for communication.

  quake/forward/Makefile:

    * Modified to include new 'commutil' module as appropriate.

  quake/forward/util.c:

    * In hu_fopen: Changed the message in the call to solver abort to include 
    the name of the file that the caller requested to open. Before it was 
    printing "fopen(...)".

  quake/forward/util.h:

    * XMALLOC_STRING: New macro to allocate character strings.

  quake/forward/psolve.c:

    * broadcast_string: Moved to commutil.c

    * broadcast_char_array: Moved to commutil.c

    * setrec: Modified to return early when a cvm query returns a secondary 
      wave velocity (Vs) under the minimum velocity considered for the 
      simulation (theVsCut).

    * source_init: Changed behavior. The file with the sources is now ONLY 
      opened if the number of loaded sources for the local PE != 0.  This is to 
      prevent thousands of processes storming the file system with requests to 
      open a file, just to perform useless work, i.e., read a header to obtain 
      information the PE already had (the number of loaded nodes).  This is also 
      part of a bug fix for the forces generation for sources of type 'point'.

    * theSchedulePrintToFile: Changed default value to 0.

    * Other cosmetic-only miscellaneous changes, i.e., fixing line breaks and 
      indentation, etc.

  examples/test1:

    * Updated configuration files to include currently required parameters.
      Also, this example is for the LA basin.

  examples/terashake:

    * Created sample configuration for the terashake scenario.  Not tested yet.

********************************************************************************

2009-01-17  Julio Lopez  <jclopez at ece dot cmu dot edu>

  octor/octor.c:
  
    * Replaced the name of a structure and corresponding typedef to avoid name 
      clash conflict on Darwin / Mac OS X.

  systemdef.mk:

    * Minor cleanup.  Removed unneeded statements, etc.

  common.mk:
  
    * Cleanup.  Moved declaration of flags that are only used in the solver to 
      quake/forward/Makefile.

  Makefile:
  
    * Added support for including / excluding the compilation of the 
      visualization module via the ENABLE_VIZ flag, which can be overriden 
      in user.mk.

  quake/forward/funcname.h:
  
    * Added definition for _GNUC_PREREQ macro for cases where the compilation 
      is not done with gcc nor against glibc.

  quake/forward/util.h:
  
    * Added macro for fdatasync() for system that do not have this function.

  quake/forward/util.c:

    * Added getline replacement implementation for systems that do not have it.

  visualize/Makefile:
  
    * Minor cleanup.

  quake/forward/Makefile:
  
    * Cleanup and added support for including / excluding the visualization 
      module at compilation time. Moved variable declaration from common.mk to 
      here, for variables that are only related to the solver, e.g., 
      SOLVE_CPPFLAGS, etc.

********************************************************************************

2007-11-05  Julio Lopez  <jclopez at ece dot cmu dot edu>

  visualize/a3dmatrix.h: 
  
    * Changes in compiler version (to gcc 4.1.2) prompted a change.  Added a 
      declaration for ZeroMatrix().

  visualize/Makefile: 
  
    * modified the setting for the CXX variable in the LINUX-MPICH system 
      type -- C++ compiler specification.  It is now set to 'mpicxx' instead 
      of 'g++' directly.

  systemdef.mk: 
  
    * Added variables for the MPI_INCLUDE variable

********************************************************************************

2007-07-10  Julio Lopez  <jclopez at ece dot cmu dot edu>

  quake/forward/psolve.c:

    * Changes in various functions to coalesce freads and fwrites, eliminating 
      some of the inner loops and replacing the appropriate count parameter in 
      the call to fread/fwrite.

    * Changes in the checkpointing routines to achieve the following:

      - BUG FIX: compute the appropriate offset for files larger than 2GB.
      - The two displacement vectors for a PE are now contiguous in the 
        checkpointing file.  Before, they were spaced far apart.
      - replaced fopen/fclose/fread/fwrite with corresponding hu_fopen,...  
        utility routines from util.c.  These functions perform error checking 
        and abort on error by calling hu_solver_abort with a hopefully 
        meaningful message.

  quake/forward/util.c:

    * New file with utility routines. Corresponding utility functions for 
      fopen/fclose/fread/fwrite named hu_fopen, hu_fclose, etc. These functions 
      perform error checking and abort on error by calling hu_solver_abort with 
      a hopefully meaningful message.  Other miscellanous functions have been 
      moved to util.c In addition, there are a new set of functions for reading 
      variables from the configuration files.  The new functions are type safe, 
      more flexible and perform appropriate error checking.

********************************************************************************

2007-01-26  Julio Lopez  <jclopez at ece dot cmu dot edu>

  quake/forward/psolve.c:

    * In load_output_parameters: Added new flags "output_debug" and 
      "output_debug_file" to the configuration file in order to enable debug 
      statements at runtime.  Notice that in order to use these statements, the 
      DEBUG compilation flag must be defined.

    * In output_init_parameters: Fixed the following bug, theNTotal value is 
      not known in processors other than PE 0.  This affected the computation 
      of params->output_size.  Also, as a side-effect added code to update 
      theNTotal.

  quake/forward/output.c:

    * generate_local_string: New function used in the generation of per-PE 
      filenames.

    * po_init_debug: New function, it initializes per-PE debugging output files.

    * po_fini_debug: New function, it finalizes per-PE debuggin output, i.e., 
      it closes debuggin output files.

    * po_debug_msg: New support function to conditionally print out debug 
      messages.  Debug messages are enabled through a config file option 
      "output_debug".

    * po_print: New funtion to print the contents of a par_output_t structure.  
      Quite useful for debugging.

    * po_print_debug: Convenience wrapper function to print the contents of a 
      par_output_t structure to the debbuging output file when debugging is 
      enabled.

    * po_check_file_size: New function, it checks whether the size of a file 
      matches an expected size.

    * po_check_file_sizes: New function, it checks whether the displacement 
      and velocity output files have the expected file size.

    * compute_current_offset: New function, consolidated the offset computation 
      for the output in a single function.  This function is called from 
      write_displacement(), write_velocity() and po_do_output().

    * In po_gather_base_offset, po_init, write_displacement, and po_do_output: 
      Added DEBUG_MSG statements.

    * In po_create_file: Fixed bug in metadata header creation.  An incorrect 
      pointer was being passed to fwrite.

  quake/forward/q4showmeta.c:

    * q4_print_output_header: Cosmetic fix, output format aligment.

********************************************************************************

2006-08-14  Julio Lopez  <jclopez at ece dot cmu dot edu>

  quake/forward/psolve.c

    * In initparameters: New flag "output_mesh" added to the configuration file 
      to select whether or not the mesh should be stored to disk.

********************************************************************************

2006-08-11  Julio Lopez  <jclopez at ece dot cmu dot edu>

  quake/forward/psolve.c

    * compute_addforce_s_old: Removed this function, it was inside a #if 0 
      preprocessor macro.  The routine did not compile anymore.

    * In main: Moved the output stats collection further down towards the end 
      of the execution to obtain a better estimate of the end-to-end time.

  quake/forward/output.c

    * In po_collect_stats and po_collect_detailed_stats: Added IOPS stats.

********************************************************************************

2006-08-09  Julio Lopez  <jclopez at ece dot cmu dot edu>

  quake/forward/output.c:

    * Created code to collect aggregate I/O statisctics when performing 
      parallel I/O.

  quake/forward/psolve.c:

    * Changes to call the new routine that collects the parallel I/O stats (in 
      output.c).  Other minor changes, like deletion of old (commented out) 
      code.  Moved Ricardo's comments to the ChangeLog file.

********************************************************************************

2006-07-31  Julio Lopez  <jclopez at ece dot cmu dot edu>

  quake/forward/quakesource.c
  
    * In broadcast_info: There was an assumption about the layout of static 
      data that would not hold for other platform / compiler combinations. The 
      problem and fix is similar to the one applied in revision 1.3 of this 
      file, but for different static variables. Now data is copied to a 
      temporary (contiguous) buffer in the stack, and the MPI calls use that 
      buffer instead.  The specific part for this fix is in 
      broadcast_plane_info.

********************************************************************************

2006-07-29  Julio Lopez  <jclopez at ece dot cmu dot edu>

  quake/forward/psolve.h:

    * Added #ifdef __cplusplus to allow inclusion of this header file from C++ 
      code.  Also added #include <stdio.h>.

********************************************************************************

2006-07-24  Julio Lopez  <jclopez at ece dot cmu dot edu>

  quake/forward/psolve.c:

    * In parsetext: Declared parsetext() as extern (instead of static) in both 
      in psolve.c and psolve.h.

  quake/forward/quakesource.c

    * In parsetext: deleted the duplicated parsetext() code from quakesource.c.

********************************************************************************

2006-07-23  Julio Lopez  <jclopez at ece dot cmu dot edu>

  quake/forward/*:
  
    * All the files previous to this change were tagged with the following 
      label in the CVS repository: BEFORE_PARALLEL_OUTPUT_MOD.  All the files 
      after this change were tagged with the label: NEW_PARALLEL_IO.

  quake/forward/output.c:
  
    * This is the major change in this revision.  This file contains a new 
      version of the parallel output code.  The sequential code is still in 
      psolve.c Note: No new warning messages were introduced by this change 
      (on Linux with MPICH2).  Various warning messages related to the 
      previous output code were removed.

  quake/forward/output.h:

    * Created this file with relevant definitions for the parallel output.

  quake/forward/psolve.h:

    * Modified out_hdr_t structure to contain other relevant (and not relevant) 
    metadata for the 4D output files.

  quake/forward/psolve.c:

    * Added new configuration parameters for numerical.in.  These parameters 
      are read from the config file:

      - output_displacement
      - output_velocity
      - output_parallel
      - output_displacement_file = "filename"
      - output_velocity_file = "velocity"

      These parameters are backwards compatible in the following sense:

      1. If any of: simulation_displacement_out, simulation_velocity_out, 
         output_parallel, are not found in the configuration file they are 
         assumed to be zero (false / disabled) and it is not an error.  This 
         might change in the future.

      2. The respective file name parameters (output_displacement_file,
         output_velocity_file) are read only if output_parallel is 1 and 
         simulation_displacement_out and/or simulation_velocity_out are 
         respectively set.

      3. These variables are only read if output is not disabled at compile 
         time i.e., -DNO_OUTPUT.  Similarly, the output function is not called 
         if NO_OUTPUT is defined at compile time.

    * Modified parsetext(), so the TAB character is considered as a token 
      separator.

    * BTW, while I was at it, I fixed the following bug: A static vector 
      (theK3) was being freed in compute_K(), removed call to free().

  quake/forward/psolve.c:

    * In the calculation of the stiffness matrix, submatrices K1 and K3 have 
      been merged into only K1.  This changes has reduced solving time in about 
      30%.  Old code is still around but commented out.

    * The offdiagonal stiffness matrices are no longer included in the solution 
      of the next step displacement after the changes in the algorithm to 
      backwards differences.  Julio removed comments and commented out variable 
      definition on 2006-08-09.

    * Two new global variables have been introduced.  These thresehold values 
      are read from the numerical file and define the top values the target 
      damping and the Vp over Vs ratio can have.  The former affects only the 
      damping terms but the later affects in general the stiffnesses matrices 
      and its influence in the damping terms.  This as shown improvements in 
      the delta_t of up to double to what was needed before without 
      compromising the solution.

    * In solver_init: Old code for damping on calculating lambda: 
      lambda = edata->rho * edata->Vp * edata->Vp - 2 * mu.

    * Changes in the n_t structure due to changes on the solving algorithm 
      because of the damping problems.

2006-06-01  Ricardo Taborda  <rtaborda at cmu dot edu>
	* quake/forward/psolve.c:

	- A new algorithm for the solution of the next time step
	displacement has been implemented in order to have control over
	the damping influence in the solution.  Old computations are still
	in the code but commented out.  We will keep old code segments
	until we're done with the Terashake runs.

	- After reviewing different things regarding the damping and
	delta_t problems, two new input parameter have been included in
	the numericals file theThresholdDamping and theThresholdVpVs.

	- In local_init: double_message has been changed to 16 to include
	the two new threshold values.

2006-05-31  Ricardo Taborda  <rtaborda at cmu dot edu>

	* quake/forward/psolve.c (solver_init):

	- Old code for damping since the np structure has changed:
	np->mass2x += M * 2;

	- Old code for damping K_diag is no longer needed. The C matrix is
	no longer constructed as one by itself and the np structure has
	changed as well as the way its components are calculated:

	double K_diag;

	K_diag = (edata->edgesize / 9) * (mu * theK1[j][j].f[axis][axis]
	+ lambda * theK2[j][j].f[axis][axis]
	+ mu * theK3[j][j].f[axis][axis]);

	C = a * M + b * K_diag;

	np->mplus[axis] += (theDeltaT / 2 * C);
	np->mminus[axis] -= (theDeltaT / 2 * C);
